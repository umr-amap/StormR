A regression model using 34 major US hurricanes since 1980 with the natural log of damage per unit gross domestic product in the hurricane swath as the dependent variable and the natural logs of wind speed and wetland area in the swath as the independent variables was highly significant and explained 60\% of the variation in relative damages. A loss of 1 ha of wetland in the model corresponded to an average USD 33 000 (median = USD 5000) increase in storm damage from specific storms. Using this relationship, and taking into account the annual probability of hits by hurricanes of varying intensities, we mapped the annual value of coastal wetlands by 1km × 1km pixel and by state. The annual value ranged from USD 250 to USD 51 000 ha−1 yr−1, with a mean of USD 8240 ha−1 yr−1 (median = USD 3230 ha−1 yr−1) significantly larger than previous estimates. Coastal wetlands in the US were estimated to currently provide USD 23.2 billion yr−1 in storm protection services. Coastal wetlands function as valuable, selfmaintaining “horizontal levees” for storm protection, and also provide a host of other ecosystem services that vertical levees do not. Their restoration and preservation is an extremely cost-effective strategy for society.},

	abstract = {After nearly a century of continuous development, tropical cyclone (TC) parametric wind field models have become more sophisticated and complex and have yielded better simulation results. Currently, they are the main avenues for predicting, simulating and reconstructing TC-induced storm surges. However, there is still room for improving these models; in particular when other influencing factors are refined as much as possible in storm surge models, the calculation results are still unsatisfactory in some cases. As sea surface wind fields are the most critical factor driving the calculation of storm surges and many other TC hazards, we revisit the evolution and systematically discuss the primary construction methods of parametric wind field models proposed at different stages. The key technologies used to construct symmetric and asymmetric wind field models are highlighted. The most common empirical, theoretical, and hybrid methods for establishing and modifying these models are categorized and discussed in detail. Moreover, there are still some noteworthy factors, especially in establishing unbalanced sea surface wind fields and customizing and revising parametric models for different types of TCs, and specific recommendations for considering these supplementary factors are provided. With the emergence of new observation technologies and artificial intelligence, novel approaches for innovating parametric wind field models using these new technologies are prospectively proposed. These supplementary factors can increase the flexibility of parametric wind field models in expressing the structure of sea surface wind fields, especially in describing the observed changeable real TC asymmetries, and more accurate results in storm surge calculations and predictions of other TC hazards can finally be achieved.},

	abstract = {Results of the 1968 through 1970 Tornado Watch Experiment conducted jointly by NASA and NOAA suggested the necessity of characterizing individual tornadoes in order to improve the identity of tornado-producing nephsystems. An attempt was made, therefore, to categorize each tornado by its intensity and area. Fujita-scale wind and corresponding damage categories were devised to classify tornadoes as Gale (F0), Weak (F1), Strong (F2), Severe (F3), Devastating (F4), and Incredible (F5). Additionally, individual tornado areas were also categorized as Trace (TR), Decimicro (DM), Micro (MI), Meso (ME), Marco (MA), Giant (GI), and Decagiant (DG), thus permitting characterizing of a tornado by a combination of intensity and area, such as weak decimicro tornado, severe meso tornado, or incredible giant tornado. A test characterization of 156 Japanese tornadoes in 1950-69 was accomplished for comparison with 893 U.S. tornadoes in 1965. Unexpectedly, the percentage distribution of intensity and individual area of U.S. and Japanese tornadoes is very similar except for large and/or intense ones. Intensity distribution within the Dallas and Fargo tornadoes of 1957 was also studied in detail. It was also found that the F-scale variation along the paths of family tornadoes shows an intensity oscillation with a 45-min interval.},

Previous case studies have quantified their impact on some health outcomes for particular tropical cyclones, but a comprehensive assessment over longer periods is currently missing. Here, we used data on 70 million Medicare hospitalizations and tropical cyclone exposures over 16 years (1999–2014). We formulated a conditional quasi-Poisson model to examine how tropical cyclone exposure (days greater than Beaufort scale gale-force wind speed; ≥34 knots) affect hospitalizations for 13 mutually-exclusive, clinically-meaningful causes. We found that tropical cyclone exposure was associated with average increases in hospitalizations from several causes over the week following exposure, including respiratory diseases (14.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 10.9–17.9\%); infectious and parasitic diseases (4.3\%; 95\%CI: 1.2–8.1\%); and injuries (8.7\%; 95\%CI: 6.0–11.8\%). Average decadal tropical cyclone exposure in all impacted counties would be associated with an estimated 16,772 (95\%CI: 8,265–25,278) additional hospitalizations. Our findings demonstrate the need for targeted preparedness strategies for hospital personnel before, during, and after tropical cyclones.},

	abstract = {Owing to the limited length of observed tropical cyclone data and the effects of multidecadal internal variability, it has been a challenge to detect trends in tropical cyclone activity on a global scale. However, there is a distinct spatial pattern of the trends in tropical cyclone frequency of occurrence on a global scale since 1980, with substantial decreases in the southern Indian Ocean and western North Pacific and increases in the North Atlantic and central Pacific. Here, using a suite of high-resolution dynamical model experiments, we show that the observed spatial pattern of trends is very unlikely to be explained entirely by underlying multidecadal internal variability; rather, external forcing such as greenhouse gases, aerosols, and volcanic eruptions likely played an important role. This study demonstrates that a climatic change in terms of the global spatial distribution of tropical cyclones has already emerged in observations and may in part be attributable to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions.},

Each RSMC forecasts and monitors storms for a specific region and annually archives best-track data, which consist of information on a storm's position, intensity, and other related parameters. IBTrACS is a new dataset based on the best-track data from numerous sources. Moreover, rather than preferentially selecting one track and intensity for each storm, the mean position, the original intensities from the agencies, and summary statistics are provided. This article discusses the dataset construction, explores the tropical cyclone climatology from IBTrACS, and concludes with an analysis of uncertainty in the tropical cyclone intensity record.},

	abstract = {Abstract For applications such as windstorm underwriting or storm-surge forecasting, hurricane wind profiles are often approximated by continuous functions that are zero at the vortex center, increase to a maximum in the eyewall, and then decrease asymptotically to zero far from the center. Comparisons between the most commonly used functions and aircraft observations reveal systematic errors. Although winds near the peak are too strong, they decrease too rapidly with distance away from the peak. Pressure–wind relations for these profiles typically overestimate maximum winds. A promising alternative is a family of sectionally continuous profiles in which the wind increases as a power of radius inside the eye and decays exponentially outside the eye after a smooth polynomial transition across the eyewall. Based upon a sample of 493 observed profiles, the mean exponent for the power law is 0.79 and the mean decay length is 243 km. The database actually contains 606 aircraft sorties, but 113 of these failed quality-control screening. Hurricanes stronger than Saffir–Simpson category 2 often require two exponentials to match the observed rapid decrease of wind with radius just outside the eye and slower decrease farther away. Experimentation showed that a fixed value of 25 km was satisfactory for the faster decay length. The mean value of the slower decay length was 295 km. The mean contribution of the faster exponential to the outer profile was 0.10, but for the most intense hurricanes it sometimes exceeded 0.5. The power-law exponent and proportion of the faster decay length increased with maximum wind speed and decreased with latitude, whereas the slower decay length decreased with intensity and increased with latitude, consistent with the qualitative observation that more intense hurricanes in lower latitudes usually have more sharply peaked wind profiles.},

In this study we applied a method for reconstructing hurricane disturbance regimes developed in an earlier study of hurricanes in New England. Patterns of actual wind damage from historical records were analyzed for 85 hurricanes since European settlement in 1508. A simple meteorological model (HURRECON) was used to reconstruct the impacts of 43 hurricanes since 1851. Long-term effects of topography on a landscape scale in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were simulated with a simple topographic exposure model (EXPOS). Average return intervals across Puerto Rico for F0 damage (loss of leaves and branches) and F1 damage (scattered blowdowns, small gaps) on the Fujita scale were 4 and 6 years, respectively. At higher damage levels, a gradient was created by the direction of the storm tracks and the weakening of hurricanes over the interior mountains. Average return intervals for F2 damage (extensive blowdowns) and F3 damage (forests leveled) ranged from 15 to 33 years and 50 to 150 years, respectively, from east to west. In the LEF, the combination of steep topography and constrained peak wind directions created a complex mosaic of topographic exposure and protection, with average return intervals for F3 damage ranging from 50 years to {\textgreater}150 years. Actual forest damage was strongly dependent on land-use history and the effects of recent hurricanes. Annual and decadal timing of hurricanes varied widely. There was no clear centennial-scale trend in the number of major hurricanes over the historical period.},

We present a new method for reconstructing hurricane disturbance regimes using a combination of historical research and computer modeling. Historical evidence of wind damage for each hurricane in the selected region is quantified using the Fujita scale to produce regional maps of actual damage. A simple meteorological model (HURRECON), parameterized and tested for selected recent hurricanes, provides regional estimates of wind speed, direction, and damage for each storm. Individual reconstructions are compiled to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of hurricane impacts. Long-term effects of topography on a landscape scale are then simulated with a simple topographic exposure model (EXPOS). We applied this method to the region of New England, USA, examining hurricanes since European settlement in 1620. Results showed strong regional gradients in hurricane frequency and intensity from southeast to northwest: mean return intervals for F0 damage on the Fujita scale (loss of leaves and branches) ranged from 5 to 85 yr, mean return intervals for F1 damage (scattered blowdowns, small gaps) ranged from 10 to {\textgreater}200 yr, and mean return intervals for F2 damage (extensive blowdowns, large gaps) ranged from 85 to {\textgreater}380 yr. On a landscape scale, mean return intervals for F2 damage in the town of Petersham, Massachusetts, ranged from 125 yr across most sites to {\textgreater}380 yr on scattered lee slopes. Actual forest damage was strongly dependent on land use and natural disturbance history. Annual and decadal timing of hurricanes varied widely. There was no clear century-scale trend in the number of major hurricanes. The historical-modeling approach is applicable to any region with good historical records and will enable ecologists and land managers to incorporate insights on hurricane disturbance regimes into the interpretation and conservation of forests at landscape to regional scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract Although numerical models are essential to hurricane forecasting, many other applications require only statistical depiction of the wind distribution. In Holland's 1980 parametric profile, radius of maximum wind, maximum wind, and a measure of the profile width describe the radial variation of the axisymmetric wind. Variants of the Holland profile are used to predict insurance underwriting risk, ocean response, and storm-surge inundation. Since these calculations guide high-stakes financial and emergency managment decisions, it is logical to test them against observations. The Hurricane Research Division's flight-level database archives observations were obtained by NOAA and U.S. Air Force Reserve aircraft. The data considered here are winds and geopotential heights observed during 606 lower- and midtropospheric flights into Atlantic and eastern Pacific tropical cyclones during 1977–2000. The 493 profiles that meet quality control criteria are seasonally geographically representative. Least squares fits of the Holland model to these data provide evaluation of the parameters' distributions and critical examination of the profile's realism. Individual fitted profiles differ from the observations in a consistent pattern. The areas of strong winds in the eyewall and of nearly calm winds at the vortex center are too wide. Beyond 2 or 3 times the eye radius, the wind decreases too rapidly with distance from the center. Although the average bias in fitted profiles is {\textless}1 m s−1, the root-mean-square error is 4.2 m s−1 (5.2 m s−1 for independent data). Maximum winds estimated from the fitted Holland-profile height–wind relation average 2.5 m s−1 too strong with an rms error of 6.5 m s−1. The pattern of too strong wind spread over too much real estate exaggerates the occurrence of winds stronger than 50 m s−1 by ∼50\%.},

	abstract = {Abstract An important limitation of numerical hurricane track forecasts is the difficulty in coaxing the vortex to assume the correct initial motion. Results from a semispectral, barotropic, linear model suggest a remedy. When the model is initialized from axisymmetry and rest in a quiescent environment on a Northern Hemisphere β plane, the vortex moves toward the northwest. The asymmetric streamfunction field is a dipole such that flow between the cyclonic and anticyclonic gyres advects the vortex. This asymmetry appears to reflect a free oscillation because the asymmetric structure, and the induced motion, persists for a long time in the absence of forcing. When the β effect is turned off, the motion continues on an f plane, and the dipole can be rotated and scaled to product any desired initial motion. In the normal-mode interpretation a vortex with cyclonic circulation throughout accelerates poleward rapidly because the β effect forces a neutral mode at zero frequency. A vortex with angular momentum reduced to zero by encirclement of the cyclonic core with an annulus of anticyclonic flow experiences weaker forcing of a mode at the most anticyclonic orbital frequency of the axisymmetric circulation. Although the latter mode has a weak barotropic instability, acceleration along the curving track is slow, so that this vortex is promising for track forecasting. By careful choice of vortex position and the normal-mode asymmetry's amplitude and orientation at some time before the beginning of the forecast calculation, it is possible to “preinitialize” the vortex to pass through a target initial position at the initial time with an arbitrarily chosen initial velocity. In completely cyclonic vortices that have asymptotic decay of the swirling flow with radius, radial wave energy propagation damps the mode at zero frequency. Experimentation with a variety of axisymmetric vortex structures suggests that, with this single qualification, existence of the previously described modes is a general property of barotropic vortices scaled to resemble hurricanes.},
