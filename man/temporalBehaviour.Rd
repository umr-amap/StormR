}
\value{
For each storm and each point location, the \code{temporalBehaviour()} function returns
a data.frame. The data frames are organised into named lists. Depending on the \code{product} argument
different data.frame are returned:
\itemize{
\item if \code{product == "TS"}, the function returns a data.frame with
one row for each observation (or interpolated observation) and
four columns for wind speed (in \eqn{m.s^{-1}}), wind direction (in degree),
the observation number, and the ISO time of observations,
\item if \code{product == "PDI"}, the function returns a data.frame with one row
for each point location and one column for the PDI,
\item if \code{product == "Exposure"}, the function returns a data.frame with one
row for the duration of exposure to winds above each wind speed threshold defined
by the \code{windThreshold} argument and one column for each point location.
}
}
\description{
The \code{temporalBehaviour()} function allows computing wind speed and direction
for a given location or set of locations along the lifespan of a tropical cyclone.
It also allows to compute three associated summary statistics.
}
\details{
Storm track data sets, such as those extracted from IBRTrACKS (Knapp et
al., 2010), usually provide observation at a 3- or 6-hours temporal
resolution. In the temporalBehaviour() function, linear interpolations are
used to reach the temporal resolution specified in the \code{tempRes} argument
(default value = 60 min).

The Holland (1980) model, widely used in the literature, is based on the
'gradient wind balance in mature tropical cyclones. The wind speed distribution
is computed from the circular air pressure field, which can be derived from
the central and environmental pressure and the radius of maximum winds.

\eqn{v_r = \sqrt{\frac{b}{\rho} \times \left(\frac{R_m}{r}\right)^b \times (p_{oci} - p_c)
  \times e^{-\left(\frac{R_m}{r}\right)^b} + \left(\frac{r \times f}{2}\right)^2} -
  \left(\frac{r \times f}{2}\right)}

with,

\eqn{b = \frac{\rho \times e \times v_m^2}{p_{oci} - p_c}}

\eqn{f = 2 \times 7.29 \times 10^{-5} \sin(\phi)}

where, \eqn{v_r} is the tangential wind speed (in \eqn{m.s^{-1}}),
\eqn{b} is the shape parameter,
\eqn{\rho} is the air density set to \eqn{1.15 kg.m^{-3}},
\eqn{e} being the base of natural logarithms (~2.718282),
\eqn{v_m} the maximum sustained wind speed (in \eqn{m.s^{-1}}),
\eqn{p_{oci}} is the pressure at outermost closed isobar of the storm (in \eqn{Pa}),
\eqn{p_c} is the pressure at the centre of the storm (in \eqn{Pa}),
\eqn{r} is the distance to the eye of the storm (in \eqn{km}),
\eqn{R_m} is the radius of maximum sustained wind speed (in \eqn{km}),
\eqn{f} is the Coriolis force (in \eqn{N.kg^{-1}}, and
\eqn{\phi} being the latitude).

The Willoughby et al. (2006) model is an empirical model fitted to aircraft
observations. The model considers two regions: inside the eye and at external
radii, for which the wind formulations use different exponents to better match
observations. In this model, the wind speed increases as a power function of the
radius inside the eye and decays exponentially outside the eye after a smooth
polynomial transition across the eyewall.

\eqn{\left\{\begin{aligned}
   v_r &= v_m \times \left(\frac{r}{R_m}\right)^{n} \quad if \quad r < R_m \\
   v_r &= v_m \times \left((1-A) \times e^{-\frac{|r-R_m|}{X1}} +
   A \times e^{-\frac{|r-R_m|}{X2}}\right) \quad if \quad r \geq R_m \\
   \end{aligned}
   \right.
   }

with,

\eqn{n = 2.1340 + 0.0077 \times v_m - 0.4522 \times \ln(R_m) - 0.0038 \times |\phi|}

\eqn{X1 = 287.6 - 1.942 \times v_m + 7.799 \times \ln(R_m) + 1.819 \times |\phi|}

\eqn{A = 0.5913 + 0.0029 \times v_m - 0.1361 \times \ln(R_m) - 0.0042 \times |\phi|} and \eqn{A\ge0}

where, \eqn{v_r} is the tangential wind speed (in \eqn{m.s^{-1}}),
\eqn{v_m} is the maximum sustained wind speed (in \eqn{m.s^{-1}}),
\eqn{r} is the distance to the eye of the storm (in \eqn{km}),
\eqn{R_m} is the radius of maximum sustained wind speed (in \eqn{km}),
\eqn{\phi} is the latitude of the centre of the storm,
\eqn{X2 = 25}.

Asymmetry can be added to Holland (1980) and Willoughby et al. (2006) wind fields as follows,

\eqn{\vec{V} = \vec{V_c} + C \times \vec{V_t}}

where, \eqn{\vec{V}} is the combined asymmetric wind field,
\eqn{\vec{V_c}} is symmetric wind field,
\eqn{\vec{V_t}} is the translation speed of the storm, and
\eqn{C} is function of \eqn{r}, the distance to the eye of the storm (in \eqn{km}).

Two formulations of C proposed by Miyazaki et al. (1962) and Chen (1994) are implemented.

Miyazaki et al. (1962)
\eqn{C = e^{(-\frac{r}{500} \times \pi)}}

Chen (1994)
\eqn{C = \frac{3 \times R_m^{\frac{3}{2}} \times
  r^{\frac{3}{2}}}{R_m^3 + r^3 +R_m^{\frac{3}{2}} \times r^{\frac{3}{2}}}}

where, \eqn{R_m} is the radius of maximum sustained wind speed (in \eqn{km})

The Boose et al. (2004) model, or “HURRECON” model, is a modification of the
Holland (1980) model. In addition to adding
asymmetry, this model treats of water and land differently, using different
surface friction coefficient for each.

\eqn{v_r = F\left(v_m - S \times (1 - \sin(T)) \times \frac{v_h}{2} \right)
  \times \sqrt{\left(\frac{R_m}{r}\right)^b \times e^{1 - \left(\frac{R_m}{r}\right)^b}}}

with,

\eqn{b = \frac{\rho \times e \times v_m^2}{p_{oci} - p_c}}

where, \eqn{v_r} is the tangential wind speed (in \eqn{m.s^{-1}}),
\eqn{F} is a scaling parameter for friction (\eqn{1.0} in water, \eqn{0.8} in land),
\eqn{v_m} is the maximum sustained wind speed (in \eqn{m.s^{-1}}),
\eqn{S} is a scaling parameter for asymmetry (usually set to \eqn{1}),
\eqn{T} is the oriented angle (clockwise/counter clockwise in Northern/Southern Hemisphere) between
the forward trajectory of the storm and a radial line from the eye of the storm to point $r$
\eqn{v_h} is the storm velocity (in \eqn{m.s^{-1}}),
\eqn{R_m} is the radius of maximum sustained wind speed (in \eqn{km}),
\eqn{r} is the distance to the eye of the storm (in \eqn{km}),
\eqn{b} is the shape parameter,
\eqn{\rho = 1.15} is the air density (in \eqn{kg.m^{-3}}),
\eqn{p_{oci}} is the pressure at outermost closed isobar of the storm (in \eqn{Pa}), and
\eqn{p_c} is the pressure at the centre of the storm (\eqn{pressure} in \eqn{Pa}).
